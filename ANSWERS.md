- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

A: For two reasons: i) to get access to state and setState methods. ii) to get access to lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.


- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

 A: i) **render()** is used to render the component to the UI. It returns the JSX that we want attached          to the DOM.
    ii) **constructor()** method is used to set up the data a component will utilize on state. Any props          passed to a class component must also be passed in through the constructor.
    iii) **componentDidMount()** is used to update the UI after a component has been mounted. We can use the setState function inside of this method.
